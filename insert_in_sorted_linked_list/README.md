## Problem Description

Given a __singly linked list__ where elements are _sorted_, implement a function that __inserts a given number__ into _its correct position_. The function should ensure that the __linked list remains sorted__ after the insertion.

## Example

__Input__:

_A sorted linked list_:

`1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 7`

_Number to insert_:

`5`

__Output__:

_The updated linked list_:

`1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7`

## Constraints

- The linked list contains only integers.
- The input linked list is non-circular.
- The number to insert can be any integer, including negative values.
- The linked list can be empty.
