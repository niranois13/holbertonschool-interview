## Overview

A Linked List Palindrome problem involves determining whether a given singly reads the same forward and backward. This is similar to checking if a string is a palindrome, but with the added complexity of a linked list's structure.

## Problem Statement

Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome. A linked list is considered a palindrome if the sequence of values is the same when traversed from both the head to the tail and from the tail to the head.

### Example

Input:
```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
```
Output:
```
Linked list is a palindrome
```

### Explanation:

The linked list reads the same forwards and backwards, therefore, it is a palindrome.
